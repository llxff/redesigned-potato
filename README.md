Make a simple app where you poll someone's mentions on Twitter. Username can be provided in app config. Each mention should be saved in database with author name, text, date and amount of retweets. There's no need to support mentions in past which means we just store what we can see now. But it's highly appreciated if a couple of lines of text is provided with description how it could be done. As soon as Twitter has request rate limits it's good to have some code dealing with it.
